# Projects

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects and codebases developed as part of my thesis, as well as various side projects focused on machine learning and image segmentation using TUBIN data. The repository is divided into two main parts: **AstroTUBIN** and **TUBIN_CNN**.

### AstroTUBIN

AstroTUBIN is a meticulously crafted package that includes a collection of functions along with a Jupyter notebook designed for the extraction and analysis of astrophotometric data from images. The core objective of AstroTUBIN is to analyze the pointing stability of the TUBIN telescope and assess the impact of jitter on photometric quality. This package is essential for researchers and enthusiasts in the field of astrophysics, providing tools to process and analyze celestial data with precision.

### TUBIN_CNN

TUBIN_CNN is a diverse set of projects exploring the applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image recognition and segmentation with TUBIN data. It includes:

- Basic CNN models for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image catalog to facilitate learning and experimentation with neural networks.
- Jupyter notebooks dedicated to label map acquisition for TUBIN images, laying the groundwork for advanced image segmentation tasks.
- Training materials and notebooks for developing TUBIN image segmentation models
