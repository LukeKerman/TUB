# AstroTUBIN

## Overview

AstroTUBIN simplifies the process of astrophotometric analysis of TUBIN VIS camera as part of my master thesis. This package consists of a Jupyter notebook (`AstroTUBIN_data_pipeline.ipynb`) and a Python script (`AstroTUBIN_functions.py`) designed to work together. 

## Setup

- Ensure both `AstroTUBIN_data_pipeline.ipynb` and `AstroTUBIN_functions.py` are placed in the same directory.
- A `Testset10` folder is provided, containing five sample images for testing purposes.

## Usage

- Open `AstroTUBIN_data_pipeline.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Follow the instructions within the notebook step by step.
- Complete the process to achieve pointing data extraction (and astrophotometric) analysis.
